# Leveraging Air Quality Data and Health Informatics to Mitigate Asthma Symptoms

## Research Project

Leveraging Air Quality Data and Health Informatics to Mitigate Asthma Symptoms in the area of Environmental Data in Health Informatics 

---

## Abstract

Respiratory conditions (such as Asthma and COPD), often worsen depending on the air quality and current air pollutant levels. Using air quality data in conjunction with patient health records and inhaler usage data could be used to identify and preempt asthma symptoms caused by poor air quality. Challenges include the location-specific accuracy of traditional air quality monitoring and time delay. Future work could include advance machine learning models to take into effect these variables and past symptoms on a patient.

## Methodology

This research was guided by a review of current research and tools. Key methods included:

- **Literature Review**
- **Technology Evaluation**

---

## Findings

- Poor air quality correlates directly with increased asthma medication usage and ER visits.
- Platforms like **Propeller Health** showed reductions in hospitalizations, improved medication adherence, and high patient satisfaction.
- Despite successful outcomes, many of these platforms have shut down.
- Future research into the integration of data and ML models is needed.

## Contributions

This project was researched and presented by **Evan Rixom** as part of a health informatics course. My contributions included:

- Defining the research problem and designing the methodology
- Reviewing 7+ peer-reviewed studies and compiling findings
- Creating a professional presentation and presenting to the instructor via a Zoom Recording (available in this repo)
- Drafting an implementation roadmap for future work using smart devices and predictive analytics
